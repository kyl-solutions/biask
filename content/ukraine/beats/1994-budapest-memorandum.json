    "title": "The Broken Promise",
    "body": "Ukraine gave up the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world — larger than Britain, France, and China combined — in exchange for explicit security assurances from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Budapest Memorandum committed all three to 'respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine' and to 'refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.' Russia violated every clause in 2014. The US and UK did not enforce them. Ukraine's denuclearization is now the most consequential broken promise in post-Cold War history — and the single most powerful argument against nonproliferation.",
    "context": {
      "text": "Ukrainian politicians debated fiercely before signing. Many argued that nuclear weapons were the only reliable guarantee of sovereignty against a neighbor with a history of imperial ambition. They were overruled by international pressure and the promise of security assurances. Every subsequent Ukrainian leader who warned that Russia might invade was told it was impossible — that the post-Cold War order would hold."

    "title": "Assurances, Not Guarantees",
    "body": "Russia argues that the Budapest Memorandum was not a binding treaty but a set of political assurances — a distinction with enormous legal significance. The memorandum contained no enforcement mechanism, no mutual defense clause, and no ratification by the Russian Duma as a treaty. Moreover, Russia argues that the assurances were given to a specific Ukrainian state — one that existed within its 1994 constitutional order. When that constitutional order was overthrown by the 2014 Euromaidan revolution, Russia contends, the political basis for the assurances ceased to exist. The Crimean population's expressed desire to rejoin Russia, in this view, represented self-determination — the same principle the memorandum was meant to protect.",
    "context": {
      "text": "The legal debate over the memorandum's status is not merely academic. 'Security assurances' occupy a gray zone in international law — stronger than a political statement but weaker than a treaty obligation. The US and UK have acknowledged their commitments under the memorandum but have interpreted them as requiring consultation rather than military intervention. This interpretation left Ukraine without a credible security guarantee."
