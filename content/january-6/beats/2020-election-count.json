    "body": "The 2020 election was conducted during a global pandemic that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans — and it still achieved the highest turnout in over a century. Election officials from both parties worked under extraordinary conditions: processing record numbers of mail ballots, maintaining social distancing at polling stations, recruiting poll workers to replace elderly volunteers who couldn't safely participate. The system was tested beyond anything in living memory and it held. Every state certified its results. Every recount confirmed the outcome. Every audit — including the Republican-commissioned Arizona audit — confirmed or slightly expanded Biden's margin. The 2020 election was not stolen. It was the most scrutinized election in American history, and it withstood every challenge.",

Krebs was fired by tweet the following week. The agency's assessment was based on its monitoring of election infrastructure across all 50 states and found no evidence of system compromise."

    "title": "The Election That Didn't Feel Right",
    "body": "For millions of Americans, the 2020 election results contradicted observable reality. Trump drew enormous rallies; Biden campaigned from his basement. Trump won 18 of 19 bellwether counties; Biden won the election. Trump gained 11 million votes over 2016; he lost. In key swing states, counting stopped on election night with Trump leading, then resumed with improbable Biden margins from mail-in ballots. Chain of custody procedures were weakened or abandoned in multiple jurisdictions. Signature verification was relaxed or eliminated. In Pennsylvania, the state supreme court overrode the legislature's election deadline — a decision even Justice Alito flagged as constitutionally suspect. These weren't conspiracy theories — they were observable facts that, taken together, undermined confidence in a process that demands confidence to function.",
    "context": {
      "text": "The 'blue shift' — Biden's gains as mail ballots were counted after Election Day — was predicted by analysts and explained by Democrats voting by mail at much higher rates than Republicans (a dynamic Trump himself encouraged by telling supporters to vote in person). But the visual reality of leads evaporating overnight, combined with the removal of Republican observers in some locations, created a visceral experience of something going wrong that no amount of statistical explanation could overcome."
