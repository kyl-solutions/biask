    "body": "Oslo was a seismic shift in Israeli politics. Yitzhak Rabin — a military hero, a general who conquered the West Bank in 1967 — stood on the White House lawn and shook Yasser Arafat's hand. For the Israeli peace camp, this was vindication: security through negotiation, not just force. The accords envisioned a phased process — confidence-building steps leading to a final status agreement on borders, Jerusalem, refugees, and security. But Oslo was fragile from the start. Hamas launched suicide bombings designed to derail the process. Israeli settlers viewed it as betrayal. Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist in 1995 killed not just a leader but the political will that had made Oslo possible.",
    "context": {
      "text": "Between 1993 and 2000, Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out a series of devastating suicide bombings inside Israel. Each attack eroded public support for the peace process. Israeli leaders faced an impossible choice: continue negotiations while burying bombing victims, or halt the process and vindicate the extremists on both sides."

    "body": "Oslo asked Palestinians to recognize the state that occupied them while deferring every critical issue — borders, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements — to 'final status' talks that never concluded. In the meantime, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank doubled from approximately 110,000 in 1993 to over 200,000 by 2000. The Palestinian Authority became an administrative layer that managed the occupation on Israel's behalf, responsible for Palestinian daily life but controlling neither borders, water, nor movement. The international community treated Oslo as peace achieved, reducing pressure on Israel while settlements ate into the land Palestinians were told would become their state. For many Palestinians, Oslo didn't fail — it worked exactly as designed: buying time for facts on the ground.",

      "text": "Edward Said called Oslo a 'Palestinian Versailles' from the outset. The power asymmetry was stark: Israel negotiated from strength while the PLO, expelled from Beirut and weakened by backing Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, had little leverage. The 'interim' arrangements that were supposed to last five years became permanent features of a deepening occupation."
