## Email 1: Dylan Burns — SENT

**Subject:** Infrastructure for structured disagreement — built for modern day discourse on volatile topics
**To:** dylanburnstv@gmail.com

Dylan,

You've been hosting cross-ideological debates and building the format for honest political discourse since before most streamers knew what steelmanning meant. Between the panels that helped launch careers in the DGG space and your reporting through OffBeat Research, you've shown that rigorous engagement across perspectives is worth doing — even when it's unpopular.

biask is the platform version of that instinct.

Every event in a conflict gets told simultaneously from both perspectives — written by contributors who identify with that side, cross-reviewed by the other. Agreed facts in the center. Transparent sourcing throughout. Not false balance — honest multiplicity.

We built a Ukraine storefront: seven pivotal moments from 1991 to present, Ukrainian and Russian narratives side by side.

Open source, pre-launch. We're looking for the first voices on each topic — people who understand that engaging with the other side's reasoning is the work, not the concession.

Happy to talk if it resonates. Otherwise, I hope you're doing well. I haven't been keeping up with your coverage between trying to get a business off the ground, raising 2 beautiful daughters and hopefully contributing to building a better world for them.

## Email 2: Brianna Wu — DRAFT (send ~2026-03-04)

**Subject:** Built the infrastructure for what you've been doing by hand
**To:** brianna@hey.com

Brianna,

You've spent the last two years holding heterodox positions across hostile territory — breaking with your own political tribe, defending your reasoning on platforms that your former allies consider enemy territory, and doing it at real personal cost. That's structured disagreement performed manually.

I built the infrastructure for it.

biask is a platform where contested political events get told from both sides simultaneously — sourced, cross-reviewed, with agreed facts in the center. Not "both sides are equally right." The actual structure of the disagreement, made visible and reviewable.

We built a January 6th storefront — institutional and populist narratives, side by side, from 2016 through the Supreme Court legacy.

https://ed9680-20260225-v3-nav-fix-biask.pages.dev/january-6

Open source, pre-launch. Looking for first contributors — people who hold a position and still think understanding the opposing one matters.

Happy to talk if it resonates.

## Email 3: Zee Cohen-Sanchez — DRAFT (send ~2026-03-11)

**Subject:** A structured tool for the issue that keeps fracturing coalitions
**To:** zee@sole-strategies.com

Zee,

You know better than most that I/P is the fault line progressive coalitions can't hold together on. You've watched it fracture rooms, derail campaigns, and turn allies into enemies — not because people disagree, but because there's no shared structure for the disagreement.

biask is that structure.

Every pivotal event in a conflict gets told from both sides simultaneously — written by people who identify with that perspective, cross-reviewed by the other side. Agreed facts in the center. Transparent sourcing throughout. Not "both sides are right." Here is what each side believes and why, sourced and reviewable.

We built an Israel/Palestine storefront: 1917 to present, Israeli and Palestinian narratives side by side.

https://ed9680-20260225-v3-nav-fix-biask.pages.dev/israel-palestine

The kind of thing you could point to on a campus instead of having to personally relitigate the conflict every time it comes up. Open source, pre-launch, looking for first voices.

Happy to talk if it resonates.
