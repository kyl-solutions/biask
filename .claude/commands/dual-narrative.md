# Dual Narrative - Session Loader

## What is this?
A philanthropic project to build a wiki-like resource that tells conflict stories from both sides simultaneously. Not false balance, not advocacy - honest multiplicity.

## Test Case
Israel/Palestine - chosen as the hardest possible test. If the design works here, it works anywhere.

## Read First
1. `MEMORY.md` - Full project context, open questions, design principles
2. `designs/` - Pencil files for UI/UX
3. `docs/` - Any architectural specs or content structure docs

## Current Status
Early conceptual/design phase. Working through:
- Core timeline UI/UX
- Expand/collapse mechanics
- Counterfactual layer design
- Sourcing and credibility framework

## What are we working on?
