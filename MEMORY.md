**Name treatment:** bi*ask* — "bi" in Inter (structural), "*ask*" in Instrument Serif italic (inquiry). Lowercase b always.
**Name meaning:** bias + ask (interrogate your bias), bi (bidirectional, bilateral), ask (Socratic — the product asks, doesn't tell)

## Vision

**biask** — a platform that tells conflict stories from both sides simultaneously. Not false balance, not advocacy, but honest multiplicity. The reader should come away understanding WHY each side made the choices they did, not which side was "right."

**Go-to-market:** Open source → Demo with Israel/Palestine page → Get to Destiny.GG community → Community contributes Russia/Ukraine etc. → Kabelo personally works Rwanda.

### Design Tokens (globals.css @theme)
- **Israeli:** bg #E8EEF5, accent #2563EB, prov #F0F4F8
- **Palestinian:** bg #F5EBE8, accent #B45309, prov #FAF5F2
- **Neutrals:** page-bg #F5F5F5, surface #FFFFFF, header #000000
- **Text:** primary #000, secondary #666, muted #AAA
- **Consensus:** agreed #16A34A, disputed #F59E0B
- **Fonts:** display = Instrument Serif, body = Inter

---

## Design Decisions Made

### Color Coding
- **Israeli narrative:** Blue tint (#E8EEF5 background, #2563EB accent)
- **Palestinian narrative:** Terracotta tint (#F5EBE8 background, #B45309 accent)
- **Center timeline:** Neutral white (#FFFFFF)
- **Header:** Black (#000000) for gravitas

### Typography
- **Headlines/Titles:** Instrument Serif (italic)
- **Body/UI:** Inter
- **Approach:** Editorial, publication-style - typography carries the visual hierarchy

### Interaction Model
1. **Center column** = "Agreed Across the Divide" — ONLY facts both sides confirm
2. **Side panels** = Where the stories diverge — perspectives, interpretations, context
3. **Disputed facts** = Flagged with amber dot + "DISPUTED" badge
4. **Bridge statements** = "Contributors who disagree about [X] agree that [Y]"
5. **Cross-review** = Folded into provenance bar: "Reviewed by N opposing-side contributors"
6. **Provenance bar** = Tinted block: editorial board, cross-review count, revisions, last updated
7. **Reverse chronology (default)** = Present → Past. User lands on latest beat, scrubs backward
8. **Timeline scrubber** = Draggable. Beats = waypoints. Time traveler UX.
9. **Two-layer model** = Share surface (OG card) + Deep surface (full three-column editorial)
10. **Any beat = valid entry point** = Links can drop you into any beat
11. **How This Works strip** = In-flow methodology (Motive Detective answer)
12. **Community Composition strip** = Contributor stats (Tribal Scanner answer)

### Trust Architecture
- **Language:** "Agreed across the divide" not "Adversarially Reviewed"
- **Motive Detective →** Provenance bars, methodology link, edit history
- **Source Assassin →** Structure = authority (system > individual), cross-review badges
- **Tribal Scanner →** Visual symmetry + contribution stats from both sides
- **Consensus Seeker →** Bridge statements, agreed/disputed indicators, center column as bedrock

### Design Principles
1. **Ambient, not aggressive** - Information reveals itself
2. **Symmetry is structural** - Both sides equal visual weight
3. **Depth is optional** - Surface reading works; deep dives available
4. **No hidden editorial** - Judgments are visible
5. **Typography over color** - Editorial gravitas through type
6. **Reverse by default** - People think backwards (present → cause)
7. **Causal, not temporal** - "What preceded this?" not "Next"
8. **Rigour without institution** - Trust signals feel social-native
9. **Two layers, not two modes** - Share → deep is a zoom, not toggle
10. **Counterfactuals are humbling** - History wasn't inevitable

## Known Issues / Next Steps

- **Custom domain:** Need to set `ab83e0-20260225-demo.biask.kyl.solutions` via CF dashboard
- **OG image:** Currently SVG — some social platforms may need PNG conversion
- **Mobile responsive:** Three-column layout stacks to single column on mobile (center → Israeli → Palestinian). Could polish the mobile experience.
- **Keyboard nav:** Arrow keys work for scrubber. Consider adding touch swipe gestures.
- **Deep links:** Each beat should be a shareable URL (e.g., `/beat/1948-independence-nakba`)
- **Counterfactual layer:** Designed in Pencil but not yet built in code
- **Open source:** Need to set up GitHub repo, README, contribution guide
- **Content review:** All beat content is editorial-board-written placeholder — real version needs actual contributor review process

## Session Log

### 2026-02-25 (Session 1 - Design)
- Full design in Pencil: three-column layout, trust architecture, provenance bars
- Major pivots: center column as consensus bedrock, reverse chronology, timeline scrubber, two-layer model
- Named "biask" with dual-font wordmark

### 2026-02-25 (Session 2 - Build)
- Scaffolded Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4 + Framer Motion
- Wrote all 8 beat JSON files with full narratives, context, sources, provenance
- Built 10 React components (Header, Hero, HowItWorks, CommunityComposition, TimelineScrubber, BeatSection, NarrativeCard, AgreedFacts, CausalConnector, ProvenanceBar)
- Built main timeline page with scrubber navigation, causal connectors, end state
- Generated OG image for share surface
- **Deployed to Cloudflare Pages:** https://ab83e0-20260225-demo-biask.pages.dev

### 2026-02-25 (Session 3 - UX Polish + Contribution Flows)
- **Section reorder:** HowItWorks → Hero → CommunityComposition (methodology first, then conflict name)
- **Hero trimmed:** py-16→py-8, text-6xl→text-5xl — less scroll before content
- **SVG icons:** Replaced emojis (🤝✅👁️) with elegant single-stroke SVG icons (HandshakeIcon, ShieldCheckIcon, CrossReviewIcon)
- **Header CTAs:** Added "Review This Page" (ghost button) + "+ Submit a Conflict" (white CTA) + GitHub SVG icon
- **Causal connector moved INTO center column:** Critical UX fix — "What preceded this?" now sits directly below consensus content inside the three-column grid, not floating below the entire grid. Feels like a continuation of the reading experience.
- **Built FlowOverlay.tsx:** Shared modal component with backdrop blur, progress bar (step N of M), close button. Uses Framer Motion AnimatePresence.
- **Built ReviewFlow.tsx:** 5-step structured review — (1) select claim from current beat, (2) agree/disagree/nuance, (3) basis type (academic/journalistic/firsthand/institutional/other), (4) provide sources, (5) perspective familiarity. Stores to localStorage as `biask-reviews`.
- **Built SubmitConflictFlow.tsx:** 5-step conflict submission — (1) conflict name + region + parties, (2) "What do most people get wrong?" (the biask hook), (3) key turning points (seeds beat structure), (4) sources from both sides, (5) contributor perspective + willingness. Stores to localStorage as `biask-conflict-submissions`.
- **Key insight:** These flows ARE the product. They're Socratic prompt packs that teach contributors how to think about conflict. The output becomes either a revision brief (Review) or a conflict seed brief (Submit).
- **Deployed V2:** https://14ea7e-20260225-v2-ux-polish-biask.pages.dev
